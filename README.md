# cpprogue

cpp and roguelike

yes

build it by running `make`. this requires `ncurses` to be installed on your system

things that have been implemented:
- player movement
- game grid
- different tile types

things yet to be implemented:
- collision detection with wall tiles
- tile inspection (what's this tile, what's on the tile)
- storing map data somewhere
- key attributes of player
  - health
  - defense
  - attack
  - can do more later.
- actually make a proper gui lol

and more...
