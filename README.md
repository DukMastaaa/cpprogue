# cpprogue

cpp and roguelike

yes

run main, it's an executable. alternatively you can use the makefile to build it.

things that have been implemented:
- player movement
- game grid
- different tile types

things yet to be implemented:
- collision detection with wall tiles
- tile inspection (what's this tile, what's on the tile)
- storing map data somewhere
- key attributes of player
  - health
  - defense
  - attack
  - can do more later.
- actually make a proper gui lol

and more...
